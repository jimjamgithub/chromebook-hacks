# chromebook-hacks
allows you to mess with other chromebooks on your network (totally real)
## How to use
Make sure you have the latest version of chrome os installed, and then to write your hacks, open the crosh terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the commands line by line. if you come across target_user in the code, replace it with the username you want to target. The username will be the thing in their email before the "@".
if your code doesn't work, then check the debug section at the bottom of the page
## Turn off chromebook hack
Once the series of commands have been run, it will take 1-3 minutes to work. 
## Not working? check these common mistakes before reporting an issue:
Don't paste the code directly into the console, as that will run the code all at once, confusing crosh. Please type each line in individually.
Getting errors? check that you have the latest version of chromeOS.
Make sure that the target chromebook is on the same network as you. Sometimes schools can have multiple networks, for example, a "Devices" netork and a "Chromebooks" network. Some chromebooks could be connected to "devices" while some could be connected to "chromebooks"
