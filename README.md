# chromebook-hacks
allows you to mess with other chromebooks on your network (totally real and not fake)
## How to use
Make sure you have the latest version of chrome os installed, and then to write your hacks, open the crosh terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the commands line by line. if you come across target_user in the code, replace it with the username you want to target. The username will be the thing in their email before the "@".
